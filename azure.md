# Storage

## Azure container storage
This is a cloud-based container management, deployment, and orchestration service. It can be integrated with Kubernetes and allows using existing Azure Storage options. The key points of using this are it has rapid scale out of stateful pods, improved performance for stateful workloads, and orchestrated with Kubernetes volumes. To interact with this service using Python, you can access it through Azure Software Development Kits (SDKs) or other libraries. 
## Blob storage 
This is a service to store massive amounts of unstructured data, such as text. It is designed to serve images, store files, stream videos and audio, store data as backups or disaster recovery, and store data for analysis. Python is a language available in client libraries to utilize Blob Storage. 

# Compute

## Azure CycleCloud 
This a tool to orchestrate and manage High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments. CycleCloud capabilities include HPC Schedulers, managing compute resources, autoscale resources, monitoring and analyzing data, cluster templates, and integration with other Azure tools or other existing workflows. Various libraries and SDKs allow Python to interact and integrate tools with CycleCloud. 
## Azure Spring Apps 
This assist with deploying Spring Boot Applications without having to change any code. It provides lifecycle management with the use of comprehensive monitoring and diagnostics, CI/CD Integration, configuration management, and service discovery. It also allows for easy integration with other Azure Services. Through APIs and frameworks such as Flask or FastAPI, you can access and utilize Spring Apps. 

# Database services
## Azure Database for MySQL 
This hosts and manages MySQL databases through the cloud. It offers flexible servers and single-server deployment models.  Key aspects include scalability, security backups, monitoring, compatibility, and much more. Python can be utilized with this using web applications, SDKs, and MySQL libraries. 
## Azure Database Migration 
This simplifies and streamlines migrations from various databases to Azure data platforms with minimal downtime. Database Migration allows for offline and online migrations to be utilized, data migration is securely processed, automation, monitoring and reporting, and much more. Python can be useful with many aspects of this, but it can be utilized with automation, data transformation, ETL, SDKs, and other libraries.
